Report/Analysis:

[Rye Verille]
    For this project, in my opinion not much research was needed. Instead I found I needed to just do a little refresher on Android App Development. Therefore, before starting the project I did look back to my notes from last year in order to refresh myself on Android specific aspects needed for this application.  After doing this I was able to help Rain understand the basics of Android. For the development process we started with the xml and created the basics of the GUI. From there we outlined in the BlackJack.java file the rules and states we would need the game to have. This took a little while to put together as it is sometimes difficult to decipher exactly what kind of things truly belong in the Model (Blackjack.java) versus the controller (MainActivity.java). With that, we started creating in the MainActivity.java and started creating functionality. Our commits all came from my computer because Rain ran into issues getting Android Studio to work correctly. Therefore, we set up times to meet and work on the project together on the one computer. Rain worked on a majority of the Android specific pieces of the code such as TextView implementation into the java code and understanding how the Model and Controller work hand in hand in order to not have all of the code simply in just one file. I focused on the java pieces and teaching Rain about the Model View Controller process.

    The following assignment posed great difficulty, because Android Studio would not function properly alongside the emulator. Rye was kind enough to let me use her laptop for the duration of the assignment. Android Studio is very similar to HTML and CSS, but it provides the programmer with more freedom to create faster performance and hardware features. Rye taught me how to implement the TextView portion of the code and how to understand the Model View Controller process. Additionally, Rye handled a majority of the Java pieces. We met on several occasions to discuss solutions and approaches to the overall program. I think our careful planning and organization allowed us to complete the project with ease and in a timely manner. I would say the project took about 12 hours to complete over a span of four days. I can say that following this assignment I am more comfortable with Android Studio. However, I think more practice is necessary to become adept in this program.

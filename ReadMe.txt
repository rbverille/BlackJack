For this project not much research was needed. After taking Andriod App development I was able to help Rain understand the basics of Android. For the developement process we started with the xml and created the basics of the GUI. From there we outlined in the BlackJack.java file the rules of states we would need the game to have. With that, we started creating in the MainActivity and started creating functionality. Our commits all came from Rye's computer becuase Rain ran into issues getting Andriod Studio to work correctly with the emulator. Therefore we set up times to meet and work on the project on the one computer. Rain worked on a majority of the Andriod specific pieces of the code such as TextView implementation into the java code. Rye focused on the java pieces and teaching Rain about the Model View Controller process.

For this project not much research was needed. After taking Andriod App development I was able to help Rain understand the basics of Android. For the developement process we started with the xml and created the basics of the GUI. From there we outlined in the BlackJack.java file the rules of states we would need the game to have. With that, we started creating in the MainActivity and started creating functionality. Our commits all came from Rye's computer, because Rain ran into issues getting Andriod Studio to work correctly with the emulator. Therefore we set up times to meet and work on the project on the one computer. Rain worked on a majority of the Andriod specific pieces of the code such as TextView implementation into the java code. Rye focused on the java pieces and teaching Rain about the Model View Controller process.

The following assignment posed great difficuly, because Android Studio would not function properly alongside the emulator. Rye was kind enough to let me use her laptop for the duration of the assignment. Android Studio is very similar to HTML and CSS, but it provides the programmer with more freedom to create faster performance and hardware features. Rye taught me how to implement the TextView portion of the code and how to understand the Model View Controller process. Additionally, Rye handled a majority of the Java pieces. We met on several occasions to discuss solutions and approaches to the overall program. I think our careful planning and organization allowed us to complete the project with ease and in a timely manner. I would say the project took about 12 hours to complete over a span of four days. I can say that following this assignment I am more comfortable with Android Studio. However, I think more practice is necessary to become adept in this program.
